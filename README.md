# Person Class

In this assignment, you'll be implementing the Person class. 

Your Person class should contain the following components:
* Every person has a first name and a last name
* A constructor that is given two parameters (the desired first and last names)
* A non-static method doSomething() that prints out something like: "I am watching Netflix"
* A useful toString() method

You should write some code in the PersonClient class to test your code:
* You should create a Person object
* You should call doSomething() with your Person object
* You should print out your Person object


Add code to [Person.java](src/main/java/Person.java) to define the class, and then add code to [PersonClient.java](src/main/java/PersonClient.java) to test your code

## Run your client code with:
```shell script
make run
```
